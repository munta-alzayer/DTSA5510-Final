# DTSA5510-Final
For this final project I will take a look at 'U.S. News and World Report’s College Data'from the "ISLR" R package 
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/flyingwombat/us-news-and-world-reports-college-data/code

For this project I will apply a K-means model on my data, and attempt to identify private and public colleges from their data. 

Below is a list of the datapoints provided per college: 
- Private A factor with levels No and Yes indicating private or public university

- Apps Number of applications received

- Accept Number of applications accepted

- Enroll Number of new students enrolled

- Top10perc Pct. new students from top 10% of H.S. class

- Top25perc Pct. new students from top 25% of H.S. class

- F.Undergrad Number of fulltime undergraduates

- P.Undergrad Number of parttime undergraduates

- Outstate Out-of-state tuition

- Room.Board Room and board costs

- Books Estimated book costs

- Personal Estimated personal spending

- PhD Pct. of faculty with Ph.D.’s

- Terminal Pct. of faculty with terminal degree

- S.F.Ratio Student/faculty ratio

- perc.alumni Pct. alumni who donate

- Expend Instructional expenditure per student

- Grad.Rate Graduation rate

The data is limited as it only looks at one academic years data, expanding on this dataset will help all models to have better classification for other results (ex: rank)
